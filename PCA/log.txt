The analysis for each chain length has to be separated into different folders. Folders 100-149 are temperary folders for 3DNA analysis.
The PCA analysis in the current directory are states mixing different numbers of HUs and some lengths are missing becuase the time exceeds.

Creat folders for 2HU and 3HU cases.

Use loop*files to separate different HU cases. But it takes too long to search files, so the outputs are separate into different length-folders first, which is in ~/snapshots_nProtein/1HUper100/%(bp)i
